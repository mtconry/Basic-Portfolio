    <h1>Mike Conry</h1>

    <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>I am Michael [Mike] Conry. I was born February 8, 1991. My place of birth is Bucharest, Romania.
             I was adopted when I was eight months old by Rebecca and Thomas Conry. The early part of my life was quiet as an only child.
             As a young kid I always asked for a brother or sister! When I was six, my parents adopted my brother; Christopher Conry. 
             Thats where my life as an only child ended :-( With a six year gap between my brother and I; I was a little frustrated with the 
             idea that it would be some time before we could actually play with each other.. Let's fast forward a few years---- </p>
        <p>As far back as I can remember my brother and I would gather around with mom to watch the Kentucky basketball games--
             This was the start of my love for sports I started playing football in seventh grade.
              Youth football was great for my developement when it came to focusing and team work. School prior to being involved with sports was always a 
              struggle. The entire time I was playing football and other sports, my little brother was paying close attention.</p>
        <p>Going into high school, I attended a military school. I went from the tall and skinny eigth grader to an athletic freshman! My sophomore year, I came in as the back-up 
             quarterback. An injuy later, I was named starter in the preseason. The results of the season weren't the best as I had no protection from the offensive line and recievers 
             that couldn't catch a cold. But, I had a heck of a fun time playing the sport. In the end, what this taught me was that hard work, preparation and motivation pays off! </p>
        <p>I have gone on to play semi-pro football while in Virginia. I married a woman I met back in highschool. I am now a father of two amazing children 4 years apart. I am using what I have learned through playing sports to learn web developement; something that captures my 
             creative side. I am sure this will be a great learning experience that will open doors I have never thought possible!</p>
